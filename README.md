5. Ability to leave reviews under ads.
6. Search for ads by title in the site header.

## Setup
Follow the steps below to setup and run the project locally:

1. Clone the Repository.
2. Setup a Virtual Environment.
Navigate to your project directory and create a virtual environment using the command:
python3 -m venv venv
3. Activate the Virtual Environment.
Activate the virtual environment using the following command:
source venv/bin/activate
4. Install Dependencies.
Install all the required dependencies from the 'requirements.txt' file using the command:
pip install -r requirements.txt
5. Setup Environment Variables.
Create an .env file in the root directory of your project and define the variables 
that are in the .env.sample file
6. Initialize the Database.
python manage.py migrate
7. Start the Server
Run the command below to start Django's development server:
python manage.py runserver
The server should now be accessible on http://localhost:8000/

## Installation

As Postman is used for result visualization, the project setup will include its usage. 

1. Install Postman if you don't have it yet. It can be downloaded [here](https://www.postman.com/downloads/).
2. Clone the repository: git@github.com:glebskotnikov/bulletin_board.git
3. Install project dependencies (this command assumes that you are in the root directory of the project): pip install -r requirements.txt 
4. Run the server: python3 manage.py runserver

## Usage 

Use Postman to test the web application.

1. When your server is running, open Postman.
2. Create a new request (e.g., GET, POST, etc.).
3. Insert the server URL, for example, `http://localhost:8000/`.
4. If required, add the request body in JSON format or enter necessary parameters.
5. Press the "Send" button to send the request.
6. The server's response will be displayed at the bottom of the window.
